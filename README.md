Bootstrap, launcher, plugin and session manager written in the Python 3.4+ language and initially a self git tutorial

At this time to run the "launcher" you need to have Python 3.4.x installed.

Then for Microsoft OS users, at the command prompt type one of the following:
. To get messages printed to the console use:
  . py.exe launcher
  . python.exe launcher

. To have no console, just the application window type:
  . pyw.exe launcher
  . pythonw.exe launcher
